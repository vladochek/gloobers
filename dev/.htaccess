  # Git to store control files. Files whose names begin with a period, as well

  #
  # NOTE: This only works when mod_rewrite is loaded. Without mod_rewrite, it is
  # not possible to block access to entire directories from .htaccess, because

  # To redirect all users to access the site WITH the 'www.' prefix,
  # (http://example.com/... will be redirected to http://www.example.com/...)

  # RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. [NC]
  # RewriteRule ^ http%{ENV:protossl}://www.%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

  # To redirect all users to access the site WITHOUT the 'www.' prefix,

  # RewriteBase /drupal

  # If your site is running in a VirtualDocumentRoot at http://example.com/,
